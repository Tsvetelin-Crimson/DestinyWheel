# DestinyWheel
This is a site made to randomize a Destiny 2 loadout in a reasonable way, without requiring the account information of the player.

Currently the site has not been deployed anywhere so to use it you need to download the files and run them locally on your machine via Visual Studio Code's extention Live server (or anything else that makes a local server).

I will add a description of the funtionallity of the site in case it is not easy enough to understand:
1. Pick whichever classes you want to be allowed to roll by clicking the checkmarks*. Note that "Any" overrides any other checkmarks other than the optional one.
2. Click the "Roll" button
3. See what you get in the list of results
Optionally tick the disadvantages checkmark to get a random disadvantage with its description


*You can pick multiple classes at once in case you want 2/3 classes otherwise pick "Any" or the one class you want to be rolled.
